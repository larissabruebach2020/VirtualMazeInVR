There's an odd inconsistency where the files for Agent_B (Adult_Female_17 by default) were prefixed f006 instead of f017. 

As such, the Remapped Materials call for f006_body , _head, and _opacity, but the correct files begin f017 instead (f017_body etc.).

This is fixed for Anna (Adult_Female_12) whose files are prefixed by f012.
